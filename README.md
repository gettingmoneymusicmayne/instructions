# 🎮 Gaming Overlay System

A high-performance AI gaming overlay system that provides custom crosshairs and AI person detection for competitive gaming. Designed for use with capture cards on NVIDIA Jetson devices.

## 🎯 Features

- **Custom Crosshair Overlay**: Display your own crosshair image with customizable colors
- **AI Person Detection**: Real-time YOLO-based person detection with bounding boxes
- **Color Customization**: Choose colors for both crosshair and detection boxes
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for gaming with minimal input lag
- **Web UI Control**: Easy-to-use web interface for toggling features
- **Multiple Capture Methods**: Automatic fallback for different video capture setups

## 🔧 Hardware Setup

### Capture Card Configuration
```
Console/PC (HDMI) → Capture Card Input
Capture Card Output (HDMI) → Monitor
Capture Card USB → Jetson Nano/Orin
```

### Display Setup
- **Monitor**: Connect via DisplayPort to view the overlay
- **Jetson**: Processes video and applies overlays
- **Capture Card**: Provides video feed to Jetson via USB

## 📦 Installation

### 1. System Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-opencv gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-good wmctrl xdotool unclutter
```

### 2. Python Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. YOLO Model
The system will automatically download `yolov11n.pt` on first run. For better performance, consider TensorRT export:
```bash
# Optional: Export to TensorRT for Jetson optimization
yolo export model=yolov11n.pt format=engine
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Prepare Crosshair
Place your `crosshair.png` file in the project directory. The image should be:
- PNG format with transparency (RGBA)
- Reasonable size (64x64 to 128x128 pixels recommended)
- Clear and visible against game backgrounds

### 2. Start the System
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x launch_overlay.sh

# Start the web UI
python3 app.py
```

### 3. Access Web Interface
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

### 4. Configure Overlays
- **Crosshair Only**: Check "Custom Crosshair" for just the crosshair overlay
- **AI Detection Only**: Check "AI Person Detection" for just detection boxes
- **Both**: Check both for crosshair + AI detection
- **Colors**: Use the color pickers to customize crosshair and detection box colors
- **Apply**: Click "Apply & Launch" to start the overlay

### 5. View Results
Switch your monitor to DisplayPort to see the overlay in action. The original video feed will be displayed with your chosen overlays on top.

## 🎮 Gaming Modes

### Crosshair Mode
- Uses GStreamer for ultra-low latency
- Perfect for games requiring precise aiming
- Minimal CPU usage

### AI Detection Mode
- Real-time person detection using YOLOv11
- Shows bounding boxes around detected players
- Useful for tactical awareness

### Combined Mode
- Both crosshair and AI detection active
- Best for competitive gaming scenarios
- Optimized performance with both features

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Video Settings
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (configurable in code)
- **FPS**: 60 FPS target (120 Hz supported; see below)
- **Device**: `/dev/video0` (capture card)

### AI Settings
- **Model**: YOLOv11n (lightweight, fast)
- **Confidence**: 0.4 (adjustable)
- **Classes**: Person detection only

### Performance Tips
- Use TensorRT model for better Jetson performance
- Adjust confidence threshold based on your needs
- Monitor FPS in terminal output
- Close unnecessary applications for best performance
- For 120 Hz passthrough, prefer NV12 zero-copy and `nveglglessink`

### 120 Hz Ultra Low-Latency Display (No Overlays)

To maximize throughput on Jetson, keep frames in NV12 and use the EGL sink:

```bash
chmod +x launch_120hz.sh
./launch_120hz.sh /dev/video0 1920 1080 120
```

This path uses:
- `v4l2src io-mode=2` (DMABUF when available)
- `NV12` end-to-end with `nvvidconv` to `NVMM`
- `nveglglessink` with `sync=false qos=false` to minimize latency

### 120 Hz Composite + AI (Advanced)

The existing `launch_overlay.sh` is optimized to:
- Keep a display path in NV12 → `nveglglessink` for minimal latency
- Tee a branch to BGR via `nvvidconv` → `shmsink` for AI consumption
- Accept BGRA overlay frames via `shmsrc` for compositor integration

Run at 120 Hz by passing `120` as the FPS argument:

```bash
./launch_overlay.sh /dev/video0 1920 1080 120
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Video Feed**
- Check capture card USB connection
- Verify device permissions: `ls -la /dev/video*`
- Try different video devices: `/dev/video1`, `/dev/video2`

**Low FPS**
- Reduce resolution in `cv_display.py`
- Use TensorRT model export
- Close background applications
- Check Jetson thermal throttling

**Overlay Not Visible**
- Ensure monitor is on DisplayPort
- Check window manager settings
- Verify fullscreen mode is working

**AI Detection Issues**
- Check YOLO model download
- Verify ultralytics installation
- Adjust confidence threshold

### Debug Mode
Run with verbose output:
```bash
python3 cv_display.py --device /dev/video0 --crosshair crosshair.png
```

- **Stop**: Clean shutdown of all processes
- **Restart**: Stops previous and starts new configuration
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback for capture methods

## 🎯 Performance Metrics

- **Latency**: <16ms (60 FPS target)
- **CPU Usage**: <30% on Jetson Orin Nano
- **Memory**: <2GB RAM usage
- **Detection Speed**: 30+ FPS with YOLOv11n
